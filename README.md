# Rocket Simulation

This project aims to simulate rocket dynamics and control using ArduPilot. By employing the capabilities of ArduPilot, an open-source autopilot system commonly used in unmanned vehicles, we can model and simulate various aspects of rocket flight, including stabilization, trajectory control, and payload delivery.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- **Git**: You need Git to clone the ArduPilot repository. You can download Git from [here](https://git-scm.com/).
- **Visual Studio Code**: Visual Studio Code is the recommended integrated development environment (IDE) for this project. You can download it from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- **Docker**: Docker is required to set up the development container. You can download Docker from [here](https://www.docker.com/).

## Getting Started

To begin working with the Rocket Simulation project, follow these steps:

1. **Open the folder inside Dev Container in Visual Studio Code**:

Once you have cloned the repository, navigate to the cloned directory using Visual Studio Code.

- Launch Visual Studio Code.
- If you have the Remote - Containers extension installed, you'll be prompted to reopen the folder in a container. If not, you can install it from [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers).
- Click on "Reopen in Container" when prompted. This will set up the development environment within a Docker container with all the necessary dependencies.

2. **Start Developing**:

Once you have opened the project in the dev container, you're ready to start developing your rocket simulation using ArduPilot. You can find relevant documentation and examples within the ArduPilot repository to guide you through the process.

3. **Additional Notes**:

- Make sure Docker is running before opening the project in the dev container.
- Refer to the ArduPilot documentation for detailed information on simulation setup, rocket dynamics modeling, and control algorithms.
